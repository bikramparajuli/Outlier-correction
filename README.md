Outlier Correction (Adjustment lab one)
Outliers: 
An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst (or a consensus process) to decide what will be considered abnormal. Before abnormal observations can be singled out, it is necessary to characterize normal observations.
Mathematically identifying outliers:
lower inner fence: Q1 - 1.5*IQ
upper inner fence: Q3 + 1.5*IQ
lower outer fence: Q1 - 3*IQ
upper outer fence: Q3 + 3*IQ
Outlier detection criteria: A point beyond an inner fence on either side is considered a mild outlier. A point beyond an outer fence is considered an extreme outlier.
